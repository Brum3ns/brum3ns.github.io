I am an ethical hacker, developer and a bug bounty hunter mainly focusing on web application penetration testing and code analysis. I'm also an employee at the bug bounty platform [YesWeHack](https://www.yeswehack.com/){:target="_blank"}.

During my time as a bug bounty hunter, I have hacked into a large number of different companies. You can see some of the companies I've hacked below.
