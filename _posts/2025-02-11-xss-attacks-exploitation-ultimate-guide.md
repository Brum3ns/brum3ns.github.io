Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a super-common vulnerability that infects a victimâ€™s browser with malicious JavaScript code, which is then used to hijack the victim's data or, in some cases, take full control of accounts hosted in the application.

In this comprehensive guide, we break down every variant of XSS attack from reflected and stored to DOM and blind. We reveal practical detection methods, exploitation techniques, and real-world scenarios that demonstrate why mastering XSS is essential for any bug bounty hunter. Mastering XSS techniques is essential since it transforms common flaws into high-impact opportunities in Bug Bounty engagements. It is also considered the #1 most dangerous CWE category as well as being the most frequent bug seen on YesWeHack Bug Bounty Programs.
