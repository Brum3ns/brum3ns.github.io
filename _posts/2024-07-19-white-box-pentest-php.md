Having access to your targetâ€™s source code is obviously an invaluable advantage of white-box penetration testing.

This article will help you leverage that benefit in the context of PHP applications and using the Xdebug PHP debugger.

Specifically, you will learn how to set up a PHP web application within a docker environment; how to set up Xdebug; how to detect PHP vulnerabilities using Xdebug; common PHP vulnerabilities; and how to leverage your white-box pentest findings to enhance future black-box testing.

Follow these steps to not only unearth vulnerabilities during white-box engagements, but to also craft custom payloads you can unleash to great effect in future black-box tests.
