This article explains some novel techniques for exploiting server-side template injections (SSTIs) with complex, unique payloads that leverage default methods and syntax from various template engines. Even better, we will show how to do so without needing any quotation marks or extra plugins within the templates. All server-side template injection payloads detailed below can achieve remote code execution (RCE) on the target applications.
